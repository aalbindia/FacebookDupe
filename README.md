# ACIT 2520 Term Project ‚Äì Post Management Application

## Overview
This project is a full-stack post management system that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete posts within specific subgroups. The system includes user authentication, access control, and comment functionality. It was initially built using a **Node.js + Express** backend with an in-memory `fakeDb.ts` for data handling, and is now being enhanced with **React** for an improved frontend experience and **PostgreSQL** for persistent data storage.

## Ongoing Development
I am currently extending this project to include:

### üîê **JWT Authentication**
Implementing secure **JSON Web Token (JWT)** authentication to replace session-based login.  
This improves scalability and security while enabling smoother integration with React and APIs.

### üîî **Real-Time Notifications**
Adding **real-time notifications** using WebSockets so users receive instant updates when someone comments or interacts with their posts.  
This enhances user engagement and demonstrates real-time communication handling in Node.js.
